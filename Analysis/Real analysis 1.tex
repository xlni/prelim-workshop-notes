\begin{problem}
	Let $f$ be a $C^2$ function on the real line. Assume $f$ is bounded with bounded second derivative. Let
	\[
		A = \sup_{x\in \bb{R}} |f(x)|, \quad B = \sup_{x\in \bb{R}} |f''(x)|.
	\]
	Prove tha
	\[
		\sup_{x\in \bb{R}} |f'(x)| \leq 2\sqrt{AB}.
	\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $x_n$ be a sequence of real numbers so that $\lim_{n\to \infty} (2x_{n+1} - x_n) = x$. Show that $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = x$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $a$ and $x_0$ be positive numbers, and define the sequence $(x_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ recursively by
	\[
		x_n = \frac{1}{2}\left( x_{n-1} + \frac{a}{x_{n-1}}\right).
	\]
	Prove that this sequence converges, and find its limit.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Suppose $f$ is a continuous real valued function. Show that
	\[
		\int_0^1 f(x)x^2 \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{3} f(\xi)
	\]
	for some $\xi \in [0,1]$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $0\leq a \leq 1$ be given. Determine all nonnegative continuous functions $f$ on $[0,1]$ which satisfy the following three conditions:
	\[
		\int_0^1 f(x) \mathrm{d}x = 1, \quad \int_0^1 xf(x) \mathrm{d}x = a, \quad \int_0^1 x^2 f(x) \mathrm{d}x = a^2.
	\]
