\begin{problem}
	Prove that a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is cyclic.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$, $p\neq 3$. If $\alpha$ is a zero of the polynomial $f(x) = x^p - x + 3$ in an extension field of $F$, show that $f(x)$ has $p$ distinct zeros in the field $F(\alpha)$.

\begin{problem}
	Exhibit infinitely many pairwise nonisomorphic quadratic extensions of $\bb{Q}$ and show they are pairwise nonisomorphic.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
	Let $\bb{Q}$ be the field of rational numbers. For $\theta$ a real number, let $F_\theta = \bb{Q}(\sin\theta)$ and $E_\theta = \bb{Q}(\sin\frac{\theta}{3})$. Show that $E_\theta$ is an extension field of $F_\theta$ and determine all possibilities for $\dim_{F_\theta} E_\theta$. (Use trigonometric identities.)

\begin{problem}
	Let $p$ be a prime and $\bb{F}_p$ the field of $p$ elements. How many elements of $\bb{F}_p$ have square roots in $\bb{F}_p$? Cube roots? (You may separate into cases for $p$.)
